GOragePi HomeKit
------
Based on Dillon Hafer's [Garage Server HomeKit](https://github.com/dillonhafer/garage-server-homekit)

Refactored for use with resin.io docker containers.

Hardware I used for project:


1. [Magnetic Reed Switch](http://amzn.to/1XuUrV9) (Optional. Used for door status)
2. [Relay Shield Module](http://amzn.to/1NRZf1R)

I really like the above relay because when the power is disconnected and restored *(i.e. power goes out in the middle of the night)* the relay will remain off. That way a power outage won't open your garage door.

## Options

```
  -pin string
    8-digit Pin for securing garage door
  -relay-pin int
    GPIO pin of relay (default 17)
  -sleep int
    Time in milliseconds to keep switch closed (default 500)
  -status-pin int
    GPIO pin of reed switch (default 4)
  -version
    print version and exit
```

## Installation Instructions

#### Installation Steps Overview:

1. **[Download garage-server-homekit](#user-content-download-garage-server-homekit)**
2. **[Create init.d script](#user-content-create-initd-script)**

#### Download garage-server-homekit

**Install from source**

Make sure [go](https://golang.org/) is installed on your Raspberry Pi and then you can use `go get` for installation:

```bash
go get github.com/dillonhafer/garage-server-homekit
```

**Install from binary**

Latest binaries available at https://github.com/dillonhafer/garage-server-homekit/releases/latest

#### Create init.d script

Simply copy the init.d script from the src directory.

```bash
cp $GOPATH/src/github.com/dillonhafer/garage-server-homekit/garage-server-homekit.init /etc/init.d/garage-server-homekit
```

#### Configure init.d script

The last thing to do is to configure your init.d script to reflect your Raspberry Pi's configuration.

First set the `PIN` environment variable.

Just un-comment the following line and add your pin in the init.d script:

```bash
# /etc/init.d/garage-server-homekit...

# Remember to set a different 8-digit pin(e.g. 12391123)
# DO NOT USE the above pin. It's an example only.
PIN=12391123
```

Other configuration variables to consider are the `STATUS_PIN` and `RELAY_PIN`. Use these
to set what GPIO pins your Raspberry Pi is configured to use.

```bash
# /etc/init.d/garage-server-homekit...
STATUS_PIN=10
RELAY_PIN=25
```

Now just install and start the service:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/garage-server-homekit
sudo update-rc.d garage-server-homekit defaults
sudo service garage-server-homekit start
```

That's it! The server is now setup!

## Notes (the downside)

I wish I could make these garage door openers for friends and family, but sadly
the  `hc` library is for personal-use only. There are race conditions in the
`hc` library that I may fix in a vendored version, but I really have no reason
to contribute to that project.

I would like to find a more permissive implementation of the HomeKit bridge to
allow this project to be freely distributed in the future. I apologize for the
current inconvenience.
